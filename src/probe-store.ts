 * `supportedEfforts` set, and it always loses to a declared set. A result is
 * invalidated whenever the model's catalog row changes, so every record carries
 * a fingerprint of the fields the probe depended on.
 *
 * The file lives beside the plugin's own credential copy under `$DSH_HOME`,
 * never in the desktop app's files, and carries no token, prompt, or response
 * body — only model ids, effort spellings, and timestamps.
