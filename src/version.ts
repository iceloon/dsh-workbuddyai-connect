/**
 * Package version reported by the status CLI and written into the heartbeat.
 *
 * The value is injected at build time by tsdown's `define` (see
 * tsdown.config.ts), which replaces `__DSH_WORKBUDDYAI_VERSION__` with the
 * `version` field of package.json. Keeping package.json as the single source of
 * truth avoids the two-point-maintenance drift where a release bumps the npm
 * version but the code still reports the old one. The `typeof === 'string'`
 * guard keeps the bundle harmless when a build forgets to define it (it falls
 * back to a clearly-dev marker).
